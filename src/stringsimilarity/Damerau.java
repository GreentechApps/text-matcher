/**
 * Implementation of Damerau-Levenshtein distance with transposition (also
 * sometimes calls unrestricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance).
 * It is the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into
 * the other, where an operation is defined as an insertion, deletion, or
 * substitution of a single character, or a transposition of two adjacent
 * characters.
 * It does respect triangle inequality, and is thus a metric distance.
 * <p>
 * This is not to be confused with the optimal string alignment distance, which
 * is an extension where no substring can be edited more than once.
